Goal is to create a simple Rails app with a form including a mobile number and a message.
Using Twilio's API, send a text message to the number with the message from the form. 

Possible extentions:

- Add devise - user must be logged in to send message
- A user has to buy credits to send messages. 1 credit = 1 message. 100 credits cost Â£10. Use stripe checkout for payment.
- Push to Heroku!
